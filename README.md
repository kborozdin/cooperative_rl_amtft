# Game cooperation with reinforcement learning

In this repository you can find the supplementary code for my Master's thesis.

The notebook includes the generalized pytorch-based framework for a cooperative reinforcement learning, the amTFT algorithm implementation ([see the original paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.01068)) and the set up experiments.
